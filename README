**Game of Chance**

This is a project from Codecademy when I was learning how to write code in Python.

#### How it works ####

This is a set of popular casino games and the user starts of with Â£100 in the pot. They are then asked what games do they want to play and can run through as many games as long they have the cash.

The pot updates after everygame if the user wins or loses and eventually if you have no money to enter you will be forced out of the game - We don't want any starving families now do we?

Not all games in here are full games such as the Roulette. You do not get the option to place a bet on more bordering numbers and your winnings do not differ on how likely the win is. The wager is simply doubled and added to the original wager - Nice and easy.
